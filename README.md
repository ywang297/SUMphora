# sephora
This scraper for sephora is based on the blog post in the following link:
https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/web-scraping/scraping-sephora-and-a-flask-querying-application/

and the code from github repo: https://github.com/anselsantos/sephora_scrapy 

The code was modified to adapt to Sephora's Canadian website and some specific brands I am interested in. I also added more features to scrape for my project. It works well for some brands but not for all, I will try to figure it out later. 

I thank the author for saving me from panic attack on a lovely Tuesday night
